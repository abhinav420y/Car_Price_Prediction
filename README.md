# Car_Price_Prediction

# I have taken this dataset from kaggle and after performing basic EDA, have deployed the model via Heroku after creating a front-end.

# For the front-end, where users want to enquire about their personal cars, I have created an app.py
# For the front-end, where users want to enquire about a bunch of cars at once, I have created an app1.py
